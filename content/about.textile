Fedora was born out of frustration with other blogging platforms, specifically those that made you deal with WYSIWYG editors, stupid URL structures, and frustrating textareas. 

It was written by "Nicholas Young":http://nicholaswyoung.com - a Ruby, PHP, and Python developer - and was originally intended to run his blog, and the blogs of his friends, but grew to be a much larger project during development. Fedora was released to the open-source community on January 13, 2010.
