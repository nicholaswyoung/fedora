h1. Fedora - Blogging in style with Sinatra

h3. Why Fedora?

Simply put, because everything else did either too much, or too little. I wanted to blog without the frustrations of logging in, categorizing the post, and most of all, dealing with Wordpress' stupid WYSIWYDG (that would be "don't get") editor.

With Fedora, when inspiration strikes, you're ready to write at a moment's notice. Just open your favorite editor, and type away. Sure, you _can_ put metadata at the top of your post, but that's optional.

h3. Requirements

Ruby. Sinatra. Builder. ERB. That's it.

h3. License

Fedora is freely available, and you may use it for both commercial, or non-commercial purposes, just make sure that you comply with the attached license document.
